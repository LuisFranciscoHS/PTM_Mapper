The cypher queries and statistics about the pathway network, the protein interaction network and the proteoform network 
can be found [here](https://github.com/PathwayAnalysisPlatform/PathwayMatcher/blob/master/docs/statistics.md).

# Protein and proteoform interaction networks construction

Details on the creation of the protein interaction network as well as the proteoform interaction
network from the Reactome pathway network at the graph database can be found [here](https://github.com/PathwayAnalysisPlatform/PathwayMatcher/blob/master/docs/network_construction.md).
